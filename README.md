# JumpJump!
## BN4102 Gerontechnology for Ageing

Our group is addressing the issue of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass that affects many older adults, leading to reduced mobility and increased risk of falls. To combat this issue, we have created JumpJump, an exergame that focuses on hip mobility and strength through a specific exercise - hip abduction. The game comprises two main components: a portable resistance training tool and an online game, which are connected through sensors that detect the user's movements. The objective of the game is to help the avatar jump and avoid falling into the water, which is achieved by performing a repetition of the exercise. JumpJump is designed to make resistance training enjoyable and encourage users to exercise regularly to improve lower body functionality.
