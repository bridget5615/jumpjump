# Jumpjump!
## BN4102 Gerontechnology for Ageing

Our group has chosen to target the issue of sarcopenia amongst older adults – an age-related condition that leads to the deterioration of muscle mass and function, leading to reduced mobility. It is found that to reduce the progression of sarcopenia, resistance training can be prescribed. To tackle the issue of sarcopenia, we have come up with JumpJump! – an exergame that specifically targets hip exercises. JumpJump! involves 2 main components; a portable resistance training tool that is connected to our game. While connected to our game, one repetition of the hip abduction exercise would lead our avatar to jump and avoid falling into the body of water. Falling into the body of water would prematurely end the game. The aim of JumpJump! is to encourage players to exercise regularly whilst making resistance training fun.
